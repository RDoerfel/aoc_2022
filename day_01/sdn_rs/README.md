# Guiding Thoughts
Yes I am learning rust, no these will not be pretty. See comments in code for how I even got an answer out of this.

I'm using these challenges as a way to learn Rust, but at the same time I don't want to spend too many hours on them, so I plan on mixing in hand-calculation when most efficient and coming back for better solutions when I have the time.
